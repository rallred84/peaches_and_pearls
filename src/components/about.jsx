          Introductions are always interesting. The first time you make eye
          contact with someone else, shake their hand or share your first name
          sets the tone to forever. Sometimes it sets the tone for a long-term
          friendship and other times it&apos;s a hiccup in someone&apos;s day.
          But, as a Child of God, be it a burden or a blessing to the person
          before you, what you say, how you handle yourself, and how you choose
          to treat that very moment is extremely important.

          I&apos;ve learned overtime it&apos;s not someone&apos;s reaction to
          how you speak to them, but rather, your initial interaction and your
          reaction to how they respond. Kindness goes so much deeper than you
          will ever know. Even if the person directly in front of you reacts in
          misery and anger to your big-hearted smile, you made a difference.
          Even if that person doesn&apos;t see it in that very moment, they
          will, and that very bright hearted smile could be the final bit of
          light their heart needs to break out before Christ.

          So here I go, introducing myself with a bighearted smile of love. You
          may not see it, but know I prayed over it. I asked God to share the
          joyful love on my face and in my heart as I introduce myself to you
          from screen to screen. I&apos;m hoping that if anyone lays their eyes
          on this that maybe, just maybe, I could reflect kindness into their
          lifeâ€¦ Into your life. {"<"}3

          My name is Kimberly and I&apos;m a Texas Transplant, having been born
          in New Jersey and raised somewhere between New York, New Jersey and
          the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. This breathtakingly beautiful
          area is known by locals as the Tri-State area where the water of the
          Catskill Mountains creates perfect pizza, sandwich orders are written
          on torn up cigarette carton boxes, and history surrounds you
          everywhere you turn.

          I thought I&apos;d never leave, but when given the opportunity to
          start a new chapter exactly 1500 miles away in the greater Dallas/Ft.
          Worth area, I couldn&apos;t say no. And now, 7 years later, I wonder
          how I lived my whole life without midnight at Whataburger for
          breakfast taquitos, the sunset in the sky that never ends, and the
          passion for college football that flutters even the least sports
          driven heart.

          I LOVE JESUS. Like, a lot! I mean He is the one who gave me everything
          in my life that brings me so much love and joy.

          This includes, but is not limited to my SALVATION, handsome hubby
          Robert + his wonderful family, quatro (4) dogs & tres (3) cats,
          amazing parental units, my brother + his amazing wife and 2 lovely
          nieces, my brother from another mother + his loving family, really
          great speakers for music with the ability to lip sync to (you take
          what you can), a kitchen to cook/bake, my Breville Espresso Machine,
          hands so I can decorate my house for every season, buy things on Etsy,
          build Lego and host parties. I mean, what is life if not to fellowship
          with EVERYONE! That is my goal.
        </p>
        <p>Accept Jesus + Live For Him + Love Life + Bring people TOGETHER</p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m not sure exactly where this blog will go but I&apos;m hoping
          it will start with Jesus and end with food, fellowship, and family!
